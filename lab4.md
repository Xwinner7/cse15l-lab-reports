## **Step 4 - Log into `ieng6`**
- Key pressed: `ssh xiz189@ieng6.ucsd.edu<enter>`
- It permits me to log into the `ieng6` server without asking for a password, this is because I have previously generated a ssh key that gets stores into my public ssh key on the server. Which allows me to save up the time that are needed for typing in the password, and log in immediately.

## **Step 5 - Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)**


## **Step 6 - Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail**


## **Step 7 - Edit the code file to fix the failing test**


## **Step 8 - Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed**


## **Step 9 - Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)**




take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step. For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.
